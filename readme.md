This repository contains various files from the Streamlit 30 day challenge. 
Since it has been a while that I used them, I put them in a WIP folder.
Once validated, they will move a folder up

Later on, some python code was added to connect Streamlit to Snowflake
* JKT.py from the people at ENX
* SL_SF_Connect, me connecting to SF and displaying records

Note: the above 2 both have different methods of connecting to SF and using difference config files, which offcourse are not in the GIT repo.

ToDo: put some empty example config files in the repo.
